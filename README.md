Acadamic - Practical Data Science final project.

Project name - Analyzing Titanic Passenger Data to Predict Survival Outcomes

Status: completed

Project desciption:

Business Problem:
    • A cruise line company wants to improve emergency preparedness
    in case of a disaster. They are looking to understand which types of
    passengers are most likely to survive based on past patterns, so
    they can design better safety plans and training for future trips.
    
Solution:
    • This project analyzes data from the Titanic to find out which
    passenger characteristics affected survival. These insights can help
    cruise companies plan better for emergencies and make decisions
    that could save more lives during future disasters.
